Welcome to my repository of projects completed during the Machine Learning Engineer course offered by MLC. This course provided hands-on experience in key machine learning concepts, data analysis, and model deployment.

Overview

Throughout the course, I worked on several real-world projects focused on applying machine learning techniques to solve practical problems. These projects involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and improvement over baseline models.

This repository contains many more projects in addition to the examples listed below — all course-related work has been uploaded and organized for easy reference.

Key Concepts Covered
 • Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
 • Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
 • Model Evaluation & Optimization
 • Time Series Forecasting
 • Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 • Deep Learning with LSTM and GRU
 • Model Deployment using FastAPI
 • Working with tools like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and Transformers

Projects

1. Time Series Forecasting
 • Goal: Predict housing prices based on historical sales data.
 • Baseline: Simple mean prediction.
 • Improvement: Achieved significant performance gain using Random Forest and LSTM models with feature engineering.

2. Sentiment Analysis on Financial Texts
 • Goal: Classify financial news headlines as positive, neutral, or negative.
 • Approach: Used logistic regression and LSTM-based models. Improved accuracy from 53% baseline to 76% after tuning and using pre-trained embeddings.

3. Quote Generator using GPT
 • Goal: Generate inspirational quotes based on a dataset of 48,000+ quotes.
 • Approach: Fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on the quotes dataset. Handled low-RAM environment constraints by reducing training batch size and sequence length.

4. Diabetes Prediction API
 • Goal: Build and deploy a diabetes prediction model.
 • Tech Stack: FastAPI + Random Forest model.
 • Outcome: Created an interactive web API for predicting diabetes risk based on patient data.
